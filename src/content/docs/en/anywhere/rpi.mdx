Raspberry Pi is a very popular series of SBCs. They are cheap, easy to get, run Linux well, and have a large ecosystem of expansion cards (Hats and Bonnets) and accessories.

Fedora has upstream support for the Pi 4, 400, and 3. Ultramarine Anywhere intends to extend support to the Zero 2 and 5.

## Raspberry Pi 5

<Alert type="info">
  This device type is still in the **Planning Phase**. All information on this
  page is subject to change.
</Alert>

The Raspberry Pi 5 is not currently supported in Fedora. We intend to package the official Raspberry Pi kernel (which should also provide a better experience on the other Pi models.)

## Raspberry Pi 4 and 400

The Raspberry Pi 4 and 400 have had support in Ultramarine Linux since UM39, and desktop images since UM40. We use the Fedora kernels and boot proccess.

### Notes

- RPi4B has a 1GB and 2GB model, we suggest against running a desktop environment on these (Xfce may be alright.)
- RPi400 does not have support for WiFi in Ultramarine, this is an upstream issue.
- The Pi 4 series has native USB boot support. Your experience may be better with a fast USB Drive or SSD connected through an adapter. See [this article](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#usb-mass-storage-boot) for more info.
- If using a microSD card, we reccomend using a Class 10 microSD card, your experience will be signifcantly better than lower classes.
- If using a USB drive, ensure it's USB 3.0 or newer, 2.0 will be a signifcantly worse experience than a microSD.
- Your storage device will need to be larger than 9GB (the image is 8.59GB) We suggest 16GB so you have space for software.

### Installing

1. Grab any aarch64 [Raw Image](TBD) from our downloads page.
2. Flash it to your microSD card or drive with [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.io) or [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://flathub.org/apps/org.raspberrypi.rpi-imager)
3. Expand the root partition to fill the entire storage device. We reccomend using Gparted, get it from your edition's app store.
4. Insert the storage device into your Pi and boot up! The default login is ultramarine (password is the same.) Please change your password once logged in.

## Raspberry Pi 3

The Raspberry Pi 3 has had support in Ultramarine Linux since UM39, and desktop images since UM40. We use the Fedora kernels and boot proccess.

### Notes

- RPi3B has only 1GB of RAM, and the 3A only has 512MB, we suggest against running a desktop environment (Xfce may be alright.)
- Your microSD card will need to be larger than 9GB (the image is 8.59GB) We suggest 16GB so you have space for software.
- We reccomend using a Class 10 microSD card, your experience will be signifcantly better than lower classes.
