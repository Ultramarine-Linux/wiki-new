Surfaces require a special kernel to work properly under Ultramarine.

These are currently provided by the Surface Linux team, start by adding their repository

```shell
sudo dnf config-manager \
    --add-repo=https://pkg.surfacelinux.com/fedora/linux-surface.repo
```

Then, install the kernel and it's dependencies

```shell
sudo dnf install --allowerasing kernel-surface iptsd libwacom-surface
```

If you want to use secure boot, you need to install `surface-secureboot`, enable 3rd party keys in the EFI settings, and enroll the key in cert-manager. This does not work well on some devices, so we recommend disabling secure boot.

<Alert type="info">We intend to make this easier in future releases.</Alert>

Some Surface models may not boot with a stock copy of Ultramarine Linux. If this is the case for your device, you have to install the kernel before leaving the live environment.

1. Ensure your internal storage is mounted, Anaconda should leave it mounted by default.

2. Check the root partition, it should be mounted as `/mnt/sysroot`

3. Chroot into the installed system

```
sudo chroot /mnt/sysroot
```

4. Follow the above instructions

5. Run `dracut -f` to make sure the new kernel is installed as the initramfs.

6. Exit the chroot and reboot!
