## Minimum System Requirements

1GB RAM, 8GB storage, 16MB boot partition. Essentially any x86 ChromeOS device, with a few [exceptions](/en/everywhere/chromebook/#unsupported-devices) will work. A list of ChromeOS device boot partition sizes can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alpernebbi/depthcharge-tools/master/depthcharge_tools/boards.ini).

If you don't know if your Chromebook is x86 or not, follow these instructions:

1. Find your CPU model by opening chrome and searching `chrome://system`, then press `expand all`.
2. Once the expanded view loads, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> and search `cpuinfo`.
3. In the `cpuinfo` menu, you will see your CPU name in the `model name` row.
4. In a new tab, type 'is `(your CPU name)` x86?' and it should tell you.

Note this is not the only way to find your CPU, feel free to look online or use another method.

## Choosing Your Edition

Ultramarine Chromebook comes in 4 variants:

- **Flagship Edition**: Our default and most popular variant. Choose Flagship if you'd like a familiar and stylish experience.
- **KDE Edition**: Our second most popular variant. Choose KDE if you'd like a simply customisable experience.
- **GNOME Edition**: Elegant and Modern. Choose GNOME if you'd like a simple, unique experience.
- **Pantheon Edition**: Thoughtful and graceful. Choose Pantheon if you'd like a refined experience.

Ultramarine Linux is distributed with image files available for download from [our website](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/chromebook).

## Verifying the Safety of an Ultramarine Image (Recommended)

Ultramarine images have a matching `CHECKSUM` file that can be checked against the image itself.

They can be downloaded by clicking the `View Checksum` button on the [download page](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/chromebook).

### Verifying the Checksum on Linux and macOS

You can use the following commands to check the integrity of the images:

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.img # Generate the checksum for the image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on ChromeOS

You can use the [ChromeOS Linux Container](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux) to verify the image on ChromeOS

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.img # Generate the checksum for the image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on Windows

In Powershell, run this command:

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
# Open the CHECKSUM file with Nodepad and compare the checksum
```

## Creating the Installer

### Download [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable media from the image.

## Footnotes

- The Anaconda installer is very complex and hard to work with, we are working on a new installer that is easier to use and more reliable.
- Since Fedora 37, Fedora's official support for the Pantheon desktop environment has been dropped due to compatibility issues and the Pantheon port is now maintained by the Ultramarine Linux team. This means that the Pantheon desktop environment is only available through Ultramarine Linux, or Fedora with Terra enabled.
- Ultramarine's Budgie edition provides a close to stock Budgie experience, with a custom theme. Unlike Fedora's Budgie Spin, which provides a completely custom layout and experience.
