After Ultramarine Chromebook is fully installed and prompts you to reboot, you may safely remove your installer.

From here, you have an almost identical Ultramarine experience, however, we bundle the [Chrultrabook Controller](https://github.com/death7654/Chrultrabook-Tools) app by default to make controlling your Chromebook a bit easier.
With this app, you can set fan speeds, control the keyboard backlight, monitor system resources, and more.

And that's it! We hope you enjoy your 'new' device! Don't hesitate to reach out for support [in our chats](/en/community/community).
